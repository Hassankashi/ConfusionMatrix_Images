# ConfusionMatrix_Images
This code creates confusion matrix among images by matlab:

1) Firstly it reads all of images by *imread* function inside nested i,j for loop, because to intersection all images to eachother.

2) Secondly by the aid of *corrcoef* correlation coefficient will be computed, and save in matrix.

3) Thirdly *imagesc* will plot it.

Yellow color and generally warm colors in the map illustrate strong correlation while cold colors shows weak ones.
